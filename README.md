# Databraid Github API

## Description

An Express server/router that uses GraphQL to access GitHub's API v3 and serve information to the Databraid Github Widget. Logging in happens with Oauth2 where you will be redirected to a Github sign in screen to allow Databraid access to some information about your Github account.
