# Databraid GitHub API

## Description

GraphQL endpoints housed in an Express server to access GitHub's API v3 and serve information to the Databraid GitHub Widget. Authentication happens with Oauth2 where you will be redirected to a GitHub sign in screen to allow Databraid access to some information about your GitHub account.
